config.txt contains a list of the branch names which are saved in the tuples made by the scan algorithm.
The branches could represent specific cut vars, or the number of events passing a set of cuts.

The sequence of letters to the left of each branch name indicate the type of
variable stored in the branch.  AF = array of Float_t values, L = Long64_t
value

There is an addition flag to the right of the variable type characters which
is relevant only for branches which store a single value, like a Long64_t or
Int_t.  This flag indicates the name of the private member variable in
AnalyzeScanResults class which should be associated with this particular
branch.
